# Why making this?
I made this because someone I follow listed the triggers/squick for certain content they like. They also talked about people denying that the content they like is pure/light/fluffy when it's darker than they say and then people being shocked because they were misled by those incorrect descriptions. This made me think "Maybe I should made some like this for Evillious, a lot of fans would need it". I've seen a lot of people surprised and shocked by the dark content, like they didn't expect it.  
I first made it to look like a table, which was probably a mistake, specially because I first made it with the basic notepad and there were many empty cells in the table. Later, I changed it to make it look like it looks now, which was for the best.  
# Are you going to add SCAP/Outlaw and Lychgate/...?
I only want to make it about the novels. The code is here. You're free to expand it to include them, just mention that you edited it. You can even translate it to other languages(just don't use an automatic translator). Yes, mention that you translated it.
# Why didn't you link to Price tumblr's but you did link to a page in Spanish?
At least, I want to say who made the English translations. I'm not going to link to the blog of every translation.  
I linked to the page in Spanish because it's the easier way to guide someone to the Spanish translations.
