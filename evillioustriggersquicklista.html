		<h1>Intro</h1>
		<p>This is  to contain a list of the dark subjects, triggers and squicks that can be found in the Evillious Chronicles novels in release order.</p>
		<p>Some specific triggers/squicks will have a internal link to a context.</p>
		<p>If after reading this, you think it's too dark for you, then don't read the novels.</p>
		<p>I know that Evillious also has its lighter moments, but after reading this you shouldn't sell it as something fluffy. It isn't.</p>
		<p>If you want to read the novels, but don't know Japanese, you can check pricechecktranslations in tumblr. There's also<a href="https://novelasevilliousesp.wordpress.com/novelas-ligeras-lanzamiento/"> translations into Spanish</a>.</p>
